# Performance Analysis of different ML methods on the Churn_Modeling Dataset
# Churn Modelling Dataset contains information about various customers visiting a shopping complex and weather the costomer will visit again to shop or not.
# A model to predict weather a costomer will visit the store based on provided info is generated using Linear Regression and another with a Artificial Neural Network and their performance was analysed.
# It was noted that ANN produced way better result as compared to the Linear Regression model.
Note: the dataset was divided into train and test set to perform analysis
